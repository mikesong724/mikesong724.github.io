            <p>
              I'm currently a machine learning quantitative researcher at JPMorgan Asset Management in NYC. I enjoy learning and conducting AI/ML research during my free time. 
            <p>
              My research focus is primarily on graph machine learning. Specifically, I am interested in fair and robust graph learning and unsupervised/few-shot graph learning for biology/chemistry applications such as drug design, and protein structure prediction. So far, I am fortunate to be mentored by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ece.virginia.edu/~jl6qk/">Prof. Jundong Li</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ibbr.umd.edu/profiles/brian-pierce">Prof. Brian Pierce</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
              I am also a part-time Master's student in the CS department at Columbia University. I went to undergraduate school at University of Virginia and received my B.A. in 2019.

              - Collaborated with Prof. Jundong Li on individual fairness research and developed a novel framework to reduce group level discrimination against underprevileged groups, which is a common problem in existing works <br />
              - Formulated the framework, conducted experiments on proposed framework and baselines, demonstrated better performance in fairness objectives and authored a paper that is in submission to data mining conferences <br />
              - Collaborated with Prof. Hongning Wang on a paper about learning latent low-dimensional representations of users with both their text content and social network relationship <br />
              - Developed data pipelines, conducted experiments, and produced data visualizations to help convey the results and analysis that our model can effectively embed topics and users in the same latent space for easy interpretation of downstream tasks such as link prediction and recommendation <br />
